Q. Anything you can do with react you can also do with HTML, CSS, JS then why React?
Its makes developer experince easy.
Less code and do more.
Optimization.

can I use named export and default export

Hooks - Normal js utility functions.
- useState - whenever a state variable updates react rendender the component.
- useEffect

React is good at DOM operations and rerendering
